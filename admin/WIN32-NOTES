 - ::rename fails if dest exist
 - fix libtool (remove -lstdc++)
 - strip does not work for PE exec! -- it just removes .stub 
   and .stubstr sections without taking care of .reloc choping,
   thus -Wl,-S should be added to LDFLAGS to strip dll early
 - renaming .rdata (with fixing flags) does not work on XP.
   custom ldscript (i386pei.x-no-rdata) should be used to produce
   dlls.
